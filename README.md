# Personal Project : LearningBot

This project consists in creating a Python - Telegram bot to help to learn a foreign language.

You can create decks and add them cards. A deck is simply a collection of cards, whereas a card represents the association of a word and its translation. You can launch sequences : you will be asked to guess words given its translation.
